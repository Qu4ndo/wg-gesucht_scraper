# wg-gesucht_scraper
Scraper for searching WG on wg-gesucht.de

## Functions ##
After setting up the scraper it will search the predefined url (with your specific filter options) and give you an update via pushover when new objects are being listed.

## Before use ##
Define your pushover profile token (push.py) and your app-token (main.py) before use or there will be no notification. Also add your specific Search URL with the defined filters for your city (main.py).
